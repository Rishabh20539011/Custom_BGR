## 📄 Description:  
This is a Custom designed Background removal APP with a Complete CI/CD flow and deployed on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). 🛠️🛠️

## 📋 Features:  
- This app incorporates two deep learning models. One is a pretrained model sourced from torchvision, and the other is trained on our custom dataset. Both adhere to the **Unet architecture**, with 
 a slightly different designs. It's possible to update these models within our app.
- The models can process on both**NVIDIA Cuda and CPU** but for now the model is deployed on CPU instance so the configuration files are prepared according to that.   
- You have the flexibility to adjust the image size according to your preferences; simply choose the size that suits your download needs.
- **Matting Model**, which enhances hairline accuracy in our models, is currently been disabled due to increased computation time and the necessity for a larger cloud instance.
